## Happy 2023 Birthday!!!

### Wish someone special happy birthday in a special way.

#### [See it Live](https://msk-robin.github.io/Happy-birthday-2023/)

#### Update: Now you can customize all the texts without modifying the code!

I created this to celebrate my 2023 birthday and thank friends for their warm regards.

I decided to publish it so that you can use it to make the special people in your life feel a bit more of what they truly are: special.
You can create your very own happy-birthday-2023 page in a few easy steps:

* Fork the repository
* Open `customize.json` and replace the content with your own
* Turn on GitHub pages for your repository (Settings > Pages)
* Share the URL you get at the above step with your friend

**You do not need to create Pull Request to this main repository to get it running.**

I've created the JSON file (`customize.json`) for easy and quick customizability. It allows you the change all of the texts and the image used on the webpage without modifying the code. However, If you want to customize it further, DELETE the JSON fields and edit the HTML file directly. This is because the content in the JSON file overwrites the HTML.

Please note that this is a starter's project and I cannot be held liable for any issues discovered.
